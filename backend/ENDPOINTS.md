## Onboarding
- login/auth
- registration:
    - on quiz completion -- account creation, data storage, return account ID/chronotype

## Main
- user CRUD
- retrieve energy level at time t/chronotype info
    - feedback button thing --> store time-series data somehow per day --> causes the graph itself to change
    NOTE: this should be a nudge/popup modal to get them to adjust the ground truth
- GPT wrapper insights
- HRV (currently simulated data from a fake endpoint???)
- sleep times (for the graph)

LATER:
- weighted tasks per unit time x screen time/weighted screen time thing idk
- Google Calendar API **remember this is sensitive (100 users max for testing aka be careful)
- Tasks integration (e.g. Todoist, TickTick)
